# Smartmove 

Smartmove is a project of recognition of movement with machine learnig. We have try many models and datasets. Some with the accelorometer, some with both the accelerometer and the gyroscope. At this day (14 mars), we are able to differentiate movement like walking, jumping, doing a 360, a sqaut, jogging. The application allow to follow some basic "training", like jumping 6 times, walking, jumping 3 times, etc.

Our work is based on the article "TensorFlow on Android for Human Activity Recognition with LSTMs work". [this blog post](https://medium.com/@curiousily/human-activity-recognition-using-lstms-on-android-tensorflow-for-hackers-part-vi-492da5adef64). The source code is compatible with TensorFlow 1.1
