# Smartmove 

Smartmove is a project of reconition of movement with machine learnig. We have try many model and dataset. Some with the accelorometer, some with the accelerometer and the gyroscope. At this day (14 mars) we are able to differentiate movement like walking, jumping, doing a 360, a sqaut, jogging. 

Our work is based on the article "TensorFlow on Android for Human Activity Recognition with LSTMs work". [this blog post](https://medium.com/@curiousily/human-activity-recognition-using-lstms-on-android-tensorflow-for-hackers-part-vi-492da5adef64). The source code is compatible with TensorFlow 1.1
